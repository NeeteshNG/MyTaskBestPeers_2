Create a simple user directory where you display a list of name cards for all the members in the
given user list.

- Each card should have the user name in the top left part and the total number of posts
by the user on the top right.

- The card should be clickable and once clicked it should show the userâ€™s detail page with
the top section displaying all user details and lower section displaying all the posts as
cards.

- The upper segment of the profile page should have Name(top left side),username and
catch phrase(below the name) Address(right top), email and phone(bottom right).

- Each post should be structured with a title section and content section with max 3 posts
in a single row.

- Design this responsively to showcase only one post in a single row for mobile view.

- Points to ensure in the system

- Each user should have a unique route to their page.

- There should be a back button for going back to people directory

- The pages should be responsive and not break in mobile views.

- You should serve the user list via states

- On click of post a pop-up is display with the complete post content. This pop-up
closes if we click outside the popup.
